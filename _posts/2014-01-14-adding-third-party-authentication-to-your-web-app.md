We've received a lot of feature requests to support other login providers such as GitHub, LinkedIn, and Google+. Once we added the Become API as discussed in my previous post, [Bring Your Own Login](http://blog.parse.com/2013/12/03/bring-your-own-login/), this became possible to achieve with Cloud Code for web apps hosted on Parse.

Today we're adding a new tutorial and example code for a simple web app that offers "Login With GitHub". A live demo of this app can be found [here](https://ghat.parseapp.com). Check out the [tutorial](https://parse.com/tutorials/adding-third-party-authentication-to-your-web-app) and browse the [source code](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/CloudCodeOAuthGitHubTutorial) for more information.

We expect that developers will quickly build upon this to support other third-party services which implement the [OAuth](http://oauth.net/) protocol.
