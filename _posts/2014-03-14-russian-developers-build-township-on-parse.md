Now building mobile games, they recently launched their first free-to-play app, <a href="http://www.playrix.com/games/freemium/township-freemium.html" target="_blank">Township</a>. A city-building game with farming elements, the app focuses on managing and setting the production of various goods.

Accustomed to optimizing their work by using dedicated third party services and solutions, Chief Creative Officer Igor Elovikov says that the company decided to use Parse for Township’s backend after stumbling on an industry article about the platform.

The game uses Parse Data to store players’ profiles. Using Parse in this way is useful because even if a player deletes the app from a device, they will continue from where they left off if they download it again. According to Igor, “Parse is very convenient and is a great time-saver. We don’t need to worry about implementing these solutions on our own and can focus on the game itself. Parse offers us a stable and reliable platform that might be very difficult for a gaming company to develop and support in-house.”

Township was launched on iOS in late 2013 and on Google Play early in 2014. In just over three months, the game achieved almost 4 million downloads with a healthy retention, allowing the game to grow organically and achieve a 4.5 star rating across 80,000 reviews on both the iTunes App Store and Google Play.

_You can download Township for free on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id638689075" target="_blank">iTunes App Store</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playrix.township" target="_blank">Google Play</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Playrix-Township/dp/B00IG2DOKM/" target="_blank">Amazon</a> and play online on <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/township/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.
