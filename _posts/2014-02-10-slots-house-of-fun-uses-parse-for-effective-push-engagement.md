Slots - House of Fun from Playtika is a great example of one such app, running on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/appcenter/houseoffun" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slots-house-of-fun/id586634331?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>, and Android (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pacificinteractive.HouseOfFun&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Play</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pacific-Interactive-Slots-House-Fun/dp/B00EC5ZFL8" target="_blank">Amazon</a>). The app has been running on Facebook for two and a half years, iOS for a year, and Android for about half a year.

With about 4 million installs of the application, Mobile Product Manager Amir Lev-Ran says that the company turned to Parse when it started to look for a good API solution and an easy system for sending push notifications. The app uses Parse to send notifications manually from the dashboard, utilizing both the broadcast option as well as to segmented users.

Now that Playtika is using Parse in the app, Amir says that, “the implementation of Parse’s SDK is very straight forward and easy. It also saved us the time of having to develop integration with the different platforms’ push notification systems.”

Amir also feels that, “the ability to integrate Parse’s system with our servers allowed us to have a powerful retention and engagement tool in a very short time,” and has the following tips for other developers thinking of adding push notifications to increase engagement with their apps:

<ul class="standard-list">
  <li>
    Think of ways to pass extra data and gifts to players in push notifications to make receiving them more enjoyable.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be careful not to abuse Push, since this can increase the likelihood that a player will delete the app.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don’t target all of the users in the database all the time and with the same messages; use segmentation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make the messages fun, short, and informative.
  </li>
</ul>
