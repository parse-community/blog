[<img style="border: 0pt none; float: right; padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/AKeys2.png" alt="Alicia Keys Vault displayed on a Macbook Pro" width="600" height="403" />]({{ site.url }}/assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/AKeys2.png)In September of 2013, a partner at <a href="http://redtapedesign.com/" target="_blank">RedTape Design</a>, a brand design studio in NYC, was asked if anyone was free to meet with someone in the lobby to talk about building a music website. RedTape agreed and they were surprised to find that the person waiting in the lobby was Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter <a href="http://aliciakeys.com/" target="_blank">Alicia Keys</a>.

Ms. Keys told the RedTape team about a collection of her music that nobody had ever heard that she wanted to find a way to share with her fans. At their next meeting, Ms. Keys showed the team a safe in the closet at her personal studio. Within the safe was years of material that no one else had ever heard, from VHS tapes to old school reel to reels, and CDs and tapes from the past 16 years. There were also photos, videos, and an archive of every magazine Ms. Keys had been on the cover of. She wanted to give all of this content to her fans, for free.

Ms. Keys had several exciting ideas about how she wanted to share her safe of material. The RedTape team was confident that they could build what she was asking for, but noted that with mockups, design, development, servers, setup, staging and testing, it would take 8 months to complete. When Ms. Keys said she wanted a finished product in 2 months, the team started to look for solutions that would help them deliver. When they found Parse, they found the tool they needed to complete the <a href="http://www.akvault.com/" target="_blank">Alicia Keys Vault</a> on time.

The RedTape team used Parse Core for several aspects of the project and reports that Parse provided them with the scale to handle the burst of simultaneous page requests that occurred on launch day, when they saw as high as 100 signups per minute, alongside over 2 million in-vault events. The app also uses Parse Core for social login, with 82% of users who registered for Alicia Keys Vault opting to use Facebook login. Additionally, Parseâ€™s ability to work side-by-side with other developer tools provided further opportunities for the RedTape, who found that the seamless integration between Parse and <a href="https://parse.com/docs/cloud_modules_guide#mandrill" target="_blank">MailChimp</a> allowed them to create a way to re-engage fans.

Now, with Parse providing the competitive edge that they need to help them grow their business at scale, <a href="http://redtapedesign.com/" target="_blank">RedTape</a> is working on building similar apps and web presences for other artists. The team is hard at work on <a href="http://www.redtapex.com/" target="_blank">RedTapeX</a>, a website and app that will reinvent the way artists interact with their fans, so check out the <a href="http://aliciakeys.com/" target="_blank">Alicia Keys Vault</a> today and stay tuned for more great Parse-powered mobile and web apps out of the RedTape team!
