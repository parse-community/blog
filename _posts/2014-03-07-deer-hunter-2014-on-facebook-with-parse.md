<a href="http://www.glu.com/" target="_blank">Glu</a>, a leading global developer and publisher of free-to-play games for smart phone and tablet devices recently turned to Parse to help bring their hit, Deer Hunter 2014, to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/appcenter/deer_hunt_two" target="_blank">Facebook</a> Canvas. Headquartered in San Francisco with teams outside Seattle and in Canada, China, India, Korea and Russia, Glu is focused on creating compelling original IP games on a wide range of platforms including iOS, Android, Windows Phone and MAC OS.

With a long history of developing for the Deer Hunter brand, acquired from Atari in 2010, this is the fifth game Glu has published in the Deer Hunter mobile series. Already aware of Parse as a tool for developing games on Facebook, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/25/facebook-parse/" target="_blank">the acquisition of Parse by Facebook</a> made it an obvious choice for Sourabh Ahuja, Vice President for Android and Cross-Platform Development at Glu. As Glu's first real attempt at a Facebook game, the team found that although there was a bit of learning curve, Parse's seamless integration with Facebook helped the team to quickly implement most of the key Facebook specific features like Facebook payments, achievements, and stories.

With more than 5 million installs to date on Facebook, Deer Hunter 2014 is not only the first game Glu has ported to Facebook using Parse, it is also their most successful title of all time in terms of overall downloads and revenue. As a result, Sourabh reports that, "In my eyes, efficiency, ease of use and stability are the most important benefits of a BaaS. Parse's seamless integration with Facebook helped us a lot in quickly implementing most of the key Facebook specific features like Facebook payments, achievements, and stories."

You can play Deer Hunter 2014 online on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/appcenter/deer_hunt_two" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, or download it for free on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/deer-hunter-2014/id583222866?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.glu.deerhunt2" target="_blank">Android</a>.
