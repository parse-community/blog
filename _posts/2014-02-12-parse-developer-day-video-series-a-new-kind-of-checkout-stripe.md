_This is a guest post from Christian Anderson, Software Engineer at <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe</a>._

Users abandon purchases for many reasons: poor design of the checkout form, the hassle of having to punch in their card details, or even just the fact that they're confronted with an unfamiliar checkout experience. With Stripe <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/checkout" target="_blank">Checkout</a>, Stripe tackles these problems so you can focus on your core business.

This video from Parse Developer Day shows viewers how to use Checkout and <a href="https://www.parse.com/docs/cloud_modules_guide#stripe" target="_blank">Parse's Stripe integration</a> to craft a great purchasing experience for your users, including a demo of the powerful Checkout feature.
