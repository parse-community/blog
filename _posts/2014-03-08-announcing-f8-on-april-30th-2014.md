It's an exciting day for the Parse team as our CEO, Ilya Sukhar, just announced at SXSW that Facebook will be hosting an <a href="https://fbf8.com" target="_blank">f8</a> this year. We're excited to be a big part of this event, and to invite you, the members of our community, to join us on April 30th, 2014 in San Francisco. Held at the San Francisco Design Concourse, f8 will be a full day of technical talks and hands-on sessions for more than 1,500 mobile and web developers from around the world. There will also be a live stream of the full event for those of you who won't be able to join in person.

We will have Parse engineers available throughout the day to provide one-on-one help and advice, and will close out the event with a celebration for attendees to unwind with drinks and entertainment.

After the success of <a href="http://www.parsedeveloperday.com/" target="_blank">Parse Developer Day</a> and <a href="http://fbmobiledeveloperday.splashthat.com/" target="_blank">Facebook + Parse Mobile Developer Day</a>, we're excited to be a part of this larger Parse + Facebook event where we can come together to explore the opportunities available to developers building on the two platforms.

Visit <a href="https://fbf8.com/" target="_blank">fbf8.com</a> to learn more and to sign up to be notified when registration opens. We'll begin accepting applications to attend soon!
