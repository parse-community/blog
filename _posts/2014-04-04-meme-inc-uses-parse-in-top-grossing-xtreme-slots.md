A three-person company until this year, when they decided to expand their team to support other platforms, all of their games are built in house, from the math models and coding, to the illustrations and sound design.

With successful titles like _Catcha Mouse,_ which climbed up to the #1 position in the App Store charts in the US, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Spain and Australia during the early days of the iTunes App Store, the team turned to Parse when they started working on newest title, Xtreme Slots.

A social casino game, Xtreme Slots launched on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/appcenter/xtremeslots" target="_blank">iOS</a> in December of 2012 and on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/appcenter/xtremeslots" target="_blank">Facebook Canvas</a> in November of 2013. The game began with 12 slot machines on the iOS version when it was first released, but after updates every two weeks to offer new slot machines and features, there are now 40 slots available to game players.

Looking for a unique, complete cloud storage service the team found Parse on Facebook and incorporated Parse into the development of Xtreme Slots. The app stores user data, sends emails, and enables Facebook Login with Parse Core, and sends targeted messages to specific players with Parse Push.

Like many apps, Xtreme Slots stores players’ progress using Parse Data. Not just a great tool for keeping track of levels and ranking, though, the team has also found that this lets them prevent user abuses that could arise from using different devices or platforms to repeat the same action, like collecting free gifts. They also use Cloud Code in Parse Core to perform validations before saving users' progress, use scheduled jobs to send e-mails to users with promotions for upcoming events, and are in the process of developing new social features using Cloud Code and scheduled jobs.

One important Parse Core feature for the app is Social Login. The app allows people to log in with Facebook via the Parse Facebook SDK so they don’t need to create an account and remember new usernames and passwords. With a core aspect of the game’s structure dependent on social interaction, and Facebook sitting at #1 in social gaming, enabling Facebook Login with Parse was an easy decision for the team. The team has also found that having users log in with Facebook allows them to offer users more options to earn virtual currency, share the experience with their friends, compete on the leaderboards, and other new features that are still in development.

Company co-founder Gonzalo Oxenford reports that,

> From our experience, Parse is a great solution for small teams that cannot afford to develop and maintain their own servers (and is worth it for large teams as well). We were looking for an OODB when we ran into Parse, and quickly fell in love with features like Push and Cloud Code. It is very well documented, easy and intuitive to use. Parse is a growing community, which means you'll see a very active forum were you can learn from others' experiences. They are constantly supporting the tool and adding new features, which makes it more interesting. The Basic plan is free and offers a generous free quota so you can try Parse by yourself and see if it fits your needs.

With 1M installs since launch, 300k monthly active users and 115k daily active users, it’s no surprise that Xtreme slots has reached as high as #150 in the US iPad App Store’s overall top grossing apps. And, at #24 in the overall grossing apps in the Australian iPhone App Store, it’s currently the second most downloaded casino app in Australia.
