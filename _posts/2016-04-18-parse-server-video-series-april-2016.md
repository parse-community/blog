We're really excited about the community which is forming around Parse Server and Parse Dashboard. In just 80 days since we launched Parse Server, more than 60 contributors from all over the world have already taken part. Parse Server is one of the most active open-source projects at Facebook, and growing incredibly quickly. This month we're releasing a group of screencasts we hope will be helpful to developers looking to get started with Parse Server. We'll span the process from setting up your development environment and running your first app, to migrating your database and even submitting changes on the open-source repository. We will also talk about JavaScript, testing, and code reviews. Let's get started!

## Development Environment Setup (OSX)



In this video, we start with a fresh installation of Mac OS X and install the basic requirements:

<ol class="standard-list">
  <li>
    <a href="http://brew.sh" target="_blank">Homebrew</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://git-scm.com" target="_blank">Git</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>
  </li>
</ol>

We also made a video for Windows users, and we'll update this spot as soon as it's ready!

## Migrating your Parse Database



In this video we step through an example migration, moving a Parse database to an external database provider. It's easy to do, and we recommend you do it as soon as possible.

Read the migration guide <a href="https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server/wiki/Migrating-an-Existing-Parse-App" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Your First Parse Server App



In this video, we set up and test both Parse Server and Parse Dashboard. The combination of these two projects with our open-source client SDKs gives you an incredibly powerful and easy-to-use mobile development framework. We also talk about how adapters can be used to extend Parse Server.

## JavaScript and Cloud Code Tips



In this video, we cover a few features of JavaScript and discuss the changes necessary when migrating from Cloud Code on Parse.com to Parse Server.

## Contributing to Parse Server



In this video, we walk through the process of creating and running tests, making changes to the codebase, and submitting pull requests to the official repository. We also touch on our code review procedures. We'd love to have you get involved and continue making Parse Server a great way to build apps.

**Parse is yours now, and everyone is welcome. Happy Building!**
