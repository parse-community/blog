Parse Server is an open-source Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform helping mobile developers build applications quickly and affordably. The framework, 
acquired by Facebook in 2013 before it was open-sourced, is supported by an active community of innovative developers. Programmers can use Parse to 
bypass tedious backend-development worries thanks to built-in tools for object and file storage, user authentication, push notifications, and simple 
third-party hosting solutions through Back4App. Read the full article on [HostingAdvice](https://www.hostingadvice.com/blog/parses-baas-platform-helps-make-the-lives-of-mobile-developers-easier/).
