It has also charted as one of the top 30 grossing apps on Android for several consecutive months. Age of Warring Empire is supported by Parse Push, and the game is popular on both the Android and iOS platforms.

While strategy and war games are popular no matter the hemisphere, Elex decided to add yet another element of complexity to Age of Warring Empire. Beyond the basics of a strategy game, the team explored RPG elements and a top-notch player vs. player system to craft a unique experience found only in Age of Warring Empire.
