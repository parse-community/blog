With our growth, it’s exciting to hear about the new markets we’re reaching and the developers in far-flung corners of the world (from our office in Menlo Park, CA) building incredible apps on the platform. Today, for instance, we have the story of multi-award winning app <a href="http://www.badlandgame.com/" target="_blank">BADLAND</a>, which comes to us from Finland-based developers, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/frogmindgames" target="_blank">Frogmind</a>.

Johannes Vuorinen started working in mobile development as a programmer in 2008 at mobile games developer Universomo/THQ Wireless studio. After 1.5 years of creating mobile games there, followed by a two-year jump into console games at RedLynx/Ubisoft studio to develop Trials Evolution for Xbox 360 as an in-game editor programmer, Johannes and his colleague Juhana Myllys decided to create their own indie game studio. Frogmind was born in April 2012.

Currently a three-man studio in Helsinki, Finland, Frogmind has one released title, BADLAND, on iOS, Android and BlackBerry 10. The team had a goal of creating a unique-looking, one-touch game with physics based gameplay designed specifically for mobile devices. Inspired to take one-touch mechanics to the extreme, BADLAND is an atmospheric side-scrolling action adventure in which the player controls a circle-shaped creature in a beautiful forest where something is terribly wrong. The player’s mission is to survive the traps and obstacles in the game.

On iOS the game has been downloaded nearly 8 million times, and the Android launch in December is catching up nicely. The app has also received numerous awards, including being named the App Store iPad Game of the Year 2013 and winning the 2013 Apple Design Award. Where does Parse come into an app with award-winning design and an experienced developer like Johannes? He heard about Parse during a game developer meeting in Helsinki when someone mentioned it might be a good, easy solution for a backend. After trying it out and finding it, “easy to use and setup,” he decided that it was a great option for their situation. That so many other developers already trusted their apps to Parse also, “validated Parse for [them] as a reliable product.”

The team moved forward and uses Parse in the Android version of the app, collecting information about unique devices that play BADLAND and monitoring game performance on them. Based on the feedback, they are able to adjust the game’s graphics and other settings for those devices to improve the game performance by loading device (or GPU)-specific configuration files from Parse. The team is also using Parse Push, to let players know about new available content. After using Parse in BADLAND, Johannes concludes that, “it reduces development time and thus cost and manpower.”

The app continues to experience rapid adoption on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frogmind.badland" target="_blank">Android</a>, with over 180,000 reviews since its December 2013 launch, and is also available on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/badland/id535176909?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS </a>and <a href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/35354890/?countrycode=US&lang=en" target="_blank">Blackberry</a>.
