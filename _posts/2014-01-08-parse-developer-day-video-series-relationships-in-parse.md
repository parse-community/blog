Unlike many human relationships, relationships in Parse aren't complicated. In this talk from Parse Developer Day, Parse Developer Advocate Prashant Sridharan breaks down object relationships in Parse.

Objects can have relationships with other objects. Whether they are one-to-one,<wbr /> one-to-many,<wbr /> or even many-to-many,<wbr /> there are a number of really easy ways to implement these relationships. This video takes a look at the different scenarios for which you will want to create relationships, shows you how to implement each of them in Parse, and then discusses some of the circumstances for when you would want to choose one over the other, and the tradeoffs in doing so.
