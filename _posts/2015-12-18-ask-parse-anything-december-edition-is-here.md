This month, developer advocates Eric and Fosco cover questions including using AWS with Parse, push notification support, the FbStart program, and much more!

<ol class="standard-list">
  <li>
    I have my own file server which stores a lot of big files like mp3, videos and also images. I want to store the URL for those files as a PFFile, not just as a URL string. It is possible? <a href="https://youtu.be/eg6_SoHuOIM?t=26" target="_blank">(0:26)</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Is there any kind of pre-release checklist to help developers ensure that their app will have a seamless transition to production? <a href="https://youtu.be/eg6_SoHuOIM?t=61" target="_blank">(1:01)</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Parse Push support for Windows 10? <a href="https://youtu.be/eg6_SoHuOIM?t=95" target="_blank">(1:35)</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    According to Parse documentation: "Tracking push opens is not supported on Unity now." When will it be supported? <a href="https://youtu.be/eg6_SoHuOIM?t=112" target="_blank">(1:52)</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Can I add the FacebookButton from PFLogInViewController to a PFSignUpViewController? Thanks! <a href="https://youtu.be/eg6_SoHuOIM?t=132" target="_blank">(2:12)</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Would you/could you have a GitHub repo to centralize issue tracking of Parse backend? <a href="https://youtu.be/eg6_SoHuOIM?t=165" target="_blank">(2:45)</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    The FbStart program is very cool, and a bit of a hidden gem. Can you tell us more about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/eg6_SoHuOIM?t=190" target="_blank">(3:10)</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    I understand the safety concerns related to class name editing. However, is there a chance you can allow us to edit class names for apps not yet in production? <a href="https://youtu.be/eg6_SoHuOIM?t=287" target="_blank">(4:47)</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Will the REST API session token expire on its own? Or do you have to create something in the code to let it expire? <a href="https://youtu.be/eg6_SoHuOIM?t=307" target="_blank">(5:07)</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Release date of Parse SDK support for watchOS 2? When is the tvOS SDK going to be available? Thanks! <a href="https://youtu.be/eg6_SoHuOIM?t=338" target="_blank">(5:38)</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Can we use Parse for sending notifications from user to user? And is it possible to do A/B testing? <a href="https://youtu.be/eg6_SoHuOIM?t=366" target="_blank">(6:06)</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Do you plan to include Passbook integration for apps? Generating passes is as complicated as push notifications and Parse solved that perfectly. <a href="https://youtu.be/eg6_SoHuOIM?t=444" target="_blank">(7:24)</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    How do I force https on static files? Using the parseExpressHttpsRedirect module still allows direct access to static files. <a href="https://youtu.be/eg6_SoHuOIM?t=474" target="_blank">(7:54)</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    I am making a mobile app that contains content submitted from users, and only appears after being approved by administrator, using a flag called “isApproved.” How do I ensure that no one can insert any content and mark it as approved themselves? <a href="https://youtu.be/eg6_SoHuOIM?t=515" target="_blank">(8:35)</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    I have AWS credits - is there any way to take advantage of these while using Parse? <a href="https://youtu.be/eg6_SoHuOIM?t=606" target="_blank">(10:06)</a>
  </li>
