<a href="http://www.foxinternationalchannels.com/" target="_blank">FOX International Channels</a> (FIC), part of 21<sup>st</sup> Century FOX (NewsCorp), is one of the top globalized TV businesses. Recognizing the need to create an online strategy to continue its growth, FIC set up departments in global regions focused on creating digital content. With Latin America emerging as the most developed region, Leonardo Rosales, Web Production Executive Director for Fox Latin American Channels, turned to <a href="https://parse.com" target="_blank">Parse</a> to power Push notifications for their mobile strategy.

Charged with developing mobile and web apps on all major platforms that will attract both new and existing users, Leonardo oversees the development of mobile apps for FIC brands. Beginning with a focus in Latin America, the team has developed two apps that use Parse Push to keep their audiences engaged.

Inspired by the success of a 2010 World Cup Facebook game built in partnership with Three Melons that had 17M installs in 6 months, the team adjusted to the new mobile market with <a href="http://www.foxsportsreview.com/" target="_blank">Fox Sports Review</a>. A soccer game built on Unity and available on <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/foxsportsreview/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> (and coming to iOS and Android in April), the app lets you re-play the best goals in history.

The second app is a companion to <a href="http://www.foxsportsla.com/futbol/sudamerica/copa-bridgestone-libertadores/app?country=us" target="_blank">Copa Bridgestone Libertadores</a>, the most popular club soccer tournament in Latin America. Created after the team decided not to have a central sports app but to build one app for each tournament to get the best of organic traffic and appeal to specific segments, the app provides minute-by-minute coverage of games, news, videos, and galleries. One of the most exciting features, though, is that Leonardo’s team is integrating the live TV coverage with Parse-powered push notifications to enable TV audiences to participate in polls, with live results posted to TV using web services. Currently in beta testing, the team hopes to have the feature available by the first half of April, 2014.

According to Leonardo, if they hadn’t decided to use Parse for Push,

> It would have taken a lot of time and resources for us to implement our own solution. Our developers would have to start from scratch: learn how to do it, best practices, etc. and then implement it. We don’t have the IT infrastructure, and don’t know how to build it, so it would have been a pain to put everything together. Parse is already up and running for a budget price.

Copa Bridgestone Libertadores is available to soccer fans now on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/copa-bridgestone-libertadores/id595372141" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foxnetworks.csl" target="_blank">Android</a>, with over 600,000 installs to date. Fox Sports Review is now available on Facebook <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/foxsportsreview/" target="_blank">here</a> and will be available on iOS and Android in April. The FOX International Channels and FOX Sports teams also have several more exciting Parse-powered apps on their road map over the next few months, so stay tuned for those as well!
