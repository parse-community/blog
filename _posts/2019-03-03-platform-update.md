The Parse Platform has changed a lot over the the past few months with the departure of one core contributor and the introduction of new contributors. We also look back at the successes of the last year.

## The new community forum

Over the years, we have tried many ways to help you discuss implementation details, report bugs and suggest new features. Overall, we were not completely happy with the status quo.

The Gitter chat remains quite active but discussions can be hard to follow which is where the community forum comes in. It allows anyone to start a new topic or dive into an existing one. The GitHub repositories remain the place to track bugs and make contributions. We hope you will use these forum however you see fit; perhaps by discussing implementation details & strategy, writing complete guides or promoting your module or extension.

## The departure of [@flovilmart](https://twitter.com/flovilmart)

As of February 2019 [@flovilmart](https://twitter.com/flovilmart) has officially retired as a core maintainer of the Parse Platform, in his own words he no longer has the "pleasure of using the project on a daily basis". We would like to thank him for his unrelenting and longstanding support of the Parse Platform and wish him luck in the future.

As [@flovilmart](https://twitter.com/flovilmart) moves on, the platform will continue under new leadership of [@acinader](https://twitter.com/acinader) and other longstanding maintainers.

## To all new contributors both expert and novice

The Parse Community is always looking for new contributors both with expert programming and backend experience and novices. To the experts please dive into the complex issues and pull request of the [Parse Server GitHub repository](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server) and client SDKs.

If you want to keep up to date with the Parse Server repo you can star or watch it:

To the beginners out there please don't be shy there is plenty to get stuck into. Please get involved where ever you feel comfortable and venture into the unknown as well - thats how we grow! I myself was unsure how to contribute to the Parse Community so here I am writing a blog post. We also recommend making updates to the [docs](https://github.com/parse-community/docs), improving the many READMEs across the platform, helping resolve simple issues and helping out on Stack Overflow on the [Parse Server](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/parse-server) or [Parse.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/parse.com) tags.
