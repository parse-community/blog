Getting to your data is an important part of many application development flows. Whether you need to perform additional analysis on your data, back it up, or duplicate it in a different Parse app, exporting quickly becomes a crucial piece of your development toolkit.

Over the last few weeks, we've greatly improved the performance of exports, ensured that our export system could handle even the largest apps, and added some neat UI features to improve the overall experience. For larger apps, it's not very convenient to export and download all of your data if you really just need one or two collections. To help with this, we've added a menu item in the data browser that will allow you to export a single collection.

</p>

Additionally, we added a progress bar in the main app export in the settings page. Since large apps could take several hours to export, this will give you more insight into what's happening on our side.

This is a first step toward improving some of the development flows that require extracting your app's data. We have many exciting features in the pipeline but we'd love to hear your thoughts on how these flows could be improved. If you have a use case that is difficult to accomplish at the moment, reach out to us on [Parse Help](http://www.parse.com/help "Parse Help") and let us know!
