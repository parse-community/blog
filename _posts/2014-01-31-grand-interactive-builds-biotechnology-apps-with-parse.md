William Grand, founder of <a href="http://www.grandinteractive.com/" target="_blank">Grand Interactive</a>, saw the room for improvement in the Life Sciences and Biotechnology fields and began building time-saving apps for these companies.

Formerly a robotics engineer, William worked on Projects for Boston Dynamics before striking out to launch what would become Grand Interactive in 2008. After realizing he wanted to focus on his love of code, being creative, and graphics, William started with a vision of creating highly engaging specialized digital experiences. The company then had a string of successes in developing mobile technology in Biotech and Life Sciences and decided to make that their focus.

Now, Grand Interactive creates top selling, award-winning iOS and Android apps solely for biotechnology and life science companies that do more than just provide information – they create specialized digital experiences.

Grand Interactive developed Cell Imaging (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cell-imaging-hd/id442016478?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href=" https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.invitrogen.protocolsplus" target="_blank">Android</a>) and Flow Cytometry (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cytometry/id494996119?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.invitrogen.cytometry" target="_blank">Android</a>) apps for a client who came to them in 2010 to create the original version. At the time, scientists were stuck having to arduously look through product catalogs and PDFs to find information about the companies’ products. Even more time was lost when they then needed step-by-step protocols on how to use them and visuals to know what results they should see. Developing mobile apps to replace these steps solves these problems handily.

William and his team used Parse after stumbling across the platform in a search for “cloud storage.” They were then able to pitch to a multi-billion dollar company to create apps with Parse as the backend in order to cut costs and easily update content quickly. William sees this is a huge win for the client because managers no longer have to pay developers, negotiate contracts, compile and upload new IPAs and APKs, regression test, and risk breaking its apps for each update to content. They used Xamarin and the <a href="https://www.parse.com/platforms/xamarin" target="_blank">Parse Xamarin SDK</a> so that they could repeat the solution for both iOS and Android fairly quickly and further cut costs.

Using Parse wasn't just a time saver during development for Grand Interactive, but for their client, as well. Parse enables product managers to generate cross-promotional materials for other products and send out <a href="https://parse.com/products/push" target="_blank">push notifications</a> to their existing customers without having to work with IT, a painstaking process. Parse also provides further time savings by offering a web interface that is easy for non-technical managers to edit, eliminating the lag time that would be involved if IT had to update the data.

We’re happy to be playing a role in the creation of such innovative apps for the sciences and can’t wait to see what else Grand Interactive produces in the future!
