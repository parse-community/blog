At Parse, our goal has always been to find ways to make developer's lives easier. In the past we have kept this strictly digital — taking care of all of the complicated backend server technology so you can focus on what makes your app awesome. Today we're happy to announce that Parse is taking that core principle one step further to its next logical evolution, the physical world — with an infinitely scalable, on-demand pigeon fleet specializing in aerial delivery.

Recently, we've seen a growing mobile trend toward offering on-demand delivery of products and services. These apps provide real, tangible value to their customers, but it's an extremely costly field to enter. The logistics behind moving things around in the real world are complicated and ridiculously time-consuming to get right. We think birds can help, providing a revolutionary shift of power to any developer who wants to offer near-instant delivery experiences. Enabling that shift is our goal with [Parse Pigeon](http://parse.com/products/pigeon).

Pigeon was hatched from a hackathon project I worked on with one of our front end engineers, Andrew. He had recently adopted a pet pigeon and we were both amazed by its intelligence and navigational ability. It became obvious to us that we could use this animal's skills to bring a game-changing product offering to life. A few Arduinos and pigeon-poo covered t-shirts later, and we had a working proof of concept.

We're really excited to see how this helps our developers create new and unique products centered around on-demand delivery. We've been privately testing this with a few pigeon-friendly partners (one of them might rhyme with ghost-dates) and they've told us that Pigeon has changed the way they're looking at the future of their delivery back-end.

Head over to the [Parse Pigeon page](http://parse.com/products/pigeon) to learn more about this exciting new product. We've opened up our waitlist for new partners, so be sure to sign up early if you'd like to be the first to integrate the power of pigeons into your app.
