We're always building tools to make app development easy and awesome, and our suite of Parse APIs are some of the most powerful tools we have to offer. Today we're happy to expand that suite with **<a href="https://parse.com/docs/rest/guide#schemas" target="_blank">the new Schema API</a>**, which lets you see all the classes present in your app along with the fields and the types present in each field. (A schema is a representation of how data is organized in your app.)

This comes on the heels of our [brand new API Console](http://blog.parse.com/announcements/introducing-the-parse-api-console/), launched last week, which gives you quick and easy access to all functions of our REST API. It allows you to play around with the API or debug issues without writing a single line of code ****— so you can ultimately build your apps faster.

Now, the Schema API makes it even easier to programmatically accomplish things you could previously do manually with the Parse Data Browser — like dropping a class or adding a column. You can generate test data, create and delete temporary classes for your app, and generate custom views for your data—perhaps even to build your very own data browser. The Schema API also allows you to display your field names and types in our existing Data Browser.

We hope the new Schema API makes Parse more powerful than ever for you. Keep watching this space for more robust APIs coming soon!
