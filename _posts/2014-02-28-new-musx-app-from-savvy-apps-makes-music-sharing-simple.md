Having built apps for customers ranging from startups like Homesnap to household names like PBS, it’s no surprise that their newly released offering for app co-founders Eddie Sniezek and John Reardon is already off to a five-star start in the app store.

Musx is designed to be the simplest way to share music with friends. By making sharing a song as easy as sharing a photo, musx lets you access the latest music recommendations from your friends and favorite sources on a personal feed. The idea was conceived when Sniezek and Reardon recognized that having to use separate apps to discover, share and listen to music left them without an easy way to find, save and interact with suggestions from their friends.

In order to find the best way to fix this fragmented music experience, Reardon and Sniezek developed multiple beta sites and hosted large concerts to get feedback from their peers along with bands and venues. It became clear that the disconnect between where music is listened to and where it is shared caused fundamental problems for music fans and professionals alike. They raised seed capital from investors in New York and hired Savvy Apps to refine and execute the idea, initially on the iPhone.

Released on iOS in mid-February 2014, the app’s backend is powered by Parse and uses logic in Cloud Code to manage follower, popular now, and share calculations. Because musx is based on friends, the app offers Facebook and Twitter login via Parse Social to make a user’s network available immediately. The app also makes use of Parse Push to keep users engaged by notifying them when they are followed or mentioned.

With the help of Parse, Savvy Apps was able to bring musx to market faster and with lower initial costs. With the app’s great momentum, the ongoing affordability along with the capacity for scale makes them confident in their choice to use Parse for their backend.
