Building games for feature phones (using J2ME), BlackBerry, Windows Mobile, and Palm OS since 2003, one of their biggest hits to date is PBA<strong></strong>® Bowling Challenge. A freemium bowling game with multiplayer, career mode, more than 10 tournaments, and the real PBA players to play against, the app was built through close work with the Professional Bowlers Association.

Concrete Software turned to Parse to add push notifications to their apps. They use notifications to push relevant information to players, such as advertisements for limited sales and important updates with significant bug fixes or additions. Co-founder Keith Pichelman appreciates that, "Parse makes push messages simple without having to host messaging servers ourselves. We're also excited about the recent addition to support Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)."

Regularly appearing in the top 50 grossing top 50 most downloaded US Arcade and US Sports apps, the app has also been featured in the iTunes Store in countries around the world and has over 8 million installs to date.
