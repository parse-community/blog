Hacktoberfest 2017 is underway! 

We encourage you to take the time to sign up for Hacktoberfest and start contributing to parse-server or other open source projects on github.
You can find more details and signup [here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), oh and did we mention there are free tee-shirts?

<!-- more -->

If you've taken the time to sign up for Hacktoberfest, and have made (or are making) **four** pull requests between Oct. 1st - 31st you will be eligible for getting a shirt!
Note that although it's not _us_ giving shirts away we wouldn't want you to miss out on the experience!

If you're looking to get started you can submit pull requests to any of [parse community's repos](https://github.com/parse-community/).
They're all open source, they all count, and as usual any help is always appreciated.

If you're looking for more specific ways to get started check out [hacktoberfest tagged issues](https://github.com/search?l=&q=state:open+label:hacktoberfest&ref=advsearch&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93), which are ideal to jump in on.
Additionally here are some other [projects](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/#projects) that are recommended to get started with.

Wherever you choose to help you can know you're improving open source for everyone. 
You can even take the time to pat yourself on the back (or raise a glass) in honor of your good deeds!
However you choose to spend it we hope you'll enjoy the experience and continue to contribute on until next Hacktoberfest comes around.

For those who are curious here's the github [blog post](https://github.com/blog/2260-hacktoberfest-is-back) on Hacktoberfest as well.
With there only being about 2 weeks left it's time to roll up your sleeves and get hacking! 
Don't forget to have a blast (and a beer) while you're at it. Have a happy Hacktoberfest!
