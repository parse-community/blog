The Parse Platform has changed a lot over the past few months with the departure of one core contributor and the arrival of new contributors. We also look back at the successes of the last year and what's in the works for the coming months.

## The new community forum

Over the years, we have tried many ways to help you discuss implementation details, report bugs and suggest new features. Overall, we were not completely happy with the status quo.

The Gitter chat remains quite active but discussions can be hard to follow which is where the community forum comes in. It allows anyone to start a new topic or dive into an existing one. The GitHub repositories remain the place to track bugs and make contributions. We hope you will use these forums however you see fit; perhaps by discussing implementation details & strategy, writing complete guides or promoting your module or extension.

## The departure of [flovilmart](https://twitter.com/flovilmart)

As of February 2019 [flovilmart](https://twitter.com/flovilmart) has officially retired as a core maintainer of the Parse Platform, in his own words he no longer has the "pleasure of using the project on a daily basis". We would like to thank him for his unrelenting and longstanding support of the Parse Platform and wish him luck in the future.

As [flovilmart](https://twitter.com/flovilmart) moves on, the platform will continue under the new leadership of [acinader](https://twitter.com/acinader) and other longstanding maintainers.

The Parse Platform is still keeping up the pace under new leadership with [acinader](https://twitter.com/acinader) releasing version 2.2 of the JavaScript SDK just last week with special mention going to [dplewis](https://github.com/dplewis) for his amazing work on adding Local Datastore.

## I'm new, how can I get involved?

The Parse Community is always looking for new contributors both experts and novices. To the experts please dive into the complex issues and pull request of the [Parse Server GitHub repository](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server) and client SDKs.

If you want to keep up to date with the Parse Server repo you can star or watch it:

We also really value even small contributions from Parse/programming newbies. Please get involved where ever you feel comfortable and venture into the unknown as well - that's how we grow!

### How can I help?
- Making updates to the [docs](https://github.com/parse-community/docs)
- Improving the many READMEs across the platform
- Helping resolve simple issues and questions on Stack Overflow with the [Parse Server](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/parse-server) or [Parse.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/parse.com) tags.
- Writing blog posts
